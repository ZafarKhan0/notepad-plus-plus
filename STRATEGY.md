# GitHub Flow Strategy

We follow GitHub Flow:

1. All work is done in a branch.
2. Code is peer-reviewed before merging.
3. Merges happen into `main`.
4. Only reviewed and passed builds can be merged.
5. GitHub Actions handles CI/CD.

This strategy is chosen for fast, secure iteration in a single production branch.
